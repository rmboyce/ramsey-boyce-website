<p>
  Draws a fractal tree based on the number of child branches that split off from
  each parent branch, the size that each child branch will be compared to its
  parent branch, the minimum branch length the program draws, and the angle
  between branches.

<p>The branch angle scrollbar is special; it has momentum and loops.</p>
