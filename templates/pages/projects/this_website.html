<p class="smallDesc">
  A place for my projects using Flask, HTML, and Javascript
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This website is a place for me to put my projects when I complete them. I
  thought that making a website would be fun, and as a bonus I could share the
  stuff I've made.
</p>

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>
  I used Flask as a web framework along with HTML and CSS to make the web pages.
  I programmed the interactive demos using Javascript.
</p>
<p>For tools, I used Google Cloud's App Engine to host the website.</p>
