<p class="gray-desc">An image rater based on the average person's judgement</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This is a Python program I made that builds and trains a neural network which
  assigns aesthetic quality scores to images. The scores are based on what the
  average person would say. It is trained on images from the

  The ipynb is a file you can run on your computer using Jupyter Notebook. If
  you run the notebook, you will need the AVA dataset on your local computer.
  Note the hardcoded location ("E:/AVA_dataset") in the python code.

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>
  The image rater first uses the

    VGG19</a

  network to convert images from the AVA dataset into codes, then runs the codes
  through a fully-connected network with two hidden layers to return image
  ratings (see figure 1 above). The rating for an image is in the form of a
  probability distribution over the integers from 1 (lowest quality) to 10
  (highest quality).
</p>
<p>
  The network achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.52 between the predicted
  and actual ratings for a validation set of images. Additionally, I do a factor
  analysis to determine which VGG19 codes have the largest effect on image
  quality. The notebook includes functions to show a selection of images with
  high values of any VGG19 code.
