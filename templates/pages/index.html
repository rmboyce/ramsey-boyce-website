  Hello! I'm starting a master's in Computer Science at CMU this fall.
  In undergrad, I studied Computer Science and Engineering
  at UCLA. If you'd like to know more about my work experience, check

  My personal projects live on this website.

  In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing and designing puzzles.
