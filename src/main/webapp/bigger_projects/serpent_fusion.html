        <h1>Serpent Fusion</h1>
        
        <ul><li class="smallDesc">A puzzle game created with the Unity engine and C#</li></ul>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I programmed the entirety of my puzzle game Serpent Fusion on my own over about two years, and I regularly release updates. It is a challenging sokoban-style game based on Snake.</li>
            <li>If you are interested, the game is here: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1126260/Serpent_Fusion/" title="Serpent Fusion" rel="nofollow">Serpent Fusion</a></li>
            <li>Note that the game isn’t for everyone because of its difficulty.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>About Creation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Nearly all of the code is in C#, although I did tweak some ShaderLab programming to use for visual effects. Rather than program a level editor from scratch, which would take a long time, I decided to make levels in a spreadsheet. This quicker approach proved to help prototype levels faster and determine what would work sooner, aka “fail faster”. I made a program that would take my level designs in the spreadsheet and convert them into JSON strings that I could plug into my game to generate levels.</li>
            <li>The game was a learning project—I wanted to apply the programming I had learned to a larger task. Before this project, I had never programmed in C# (although I did have experience in Java), so I was able to pick up a new language. I also had a lot of fun making levels for other games, so I wanted to design my own puzzle game from scratch.</li>
            <li>In recent updates I have been refactoring the code as I learn more, to make it easier to understand and work on.</li>
